# PhoPQ Activation Model

Kenny Groszman of MIT Operations Research Center, in collaboration with Kathryn Brink of Rice University Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology PhD Program

Here, we produce a sparse robust linear model that predicts PhoPQ activation by cathelicidin-like peptides using a set of biochemical and biophysical descriptors calculated from the peptide primary amino acid sequences. The model is benchmarked against experimental data in which peptides were screened using sort-seq for their ability to activate Salmonella Typhimurium PhoPQ in an E. coli model system.
